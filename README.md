Bank Marketing Campaign

One of the bank's products is a fixed-term deposit. One way banks market this product to their customers is through telephone calls. While this method may be time-consuming, it is considered the most effective compared to other marketing methods. The investment cost for offering products via telephone is not inexpensive. Increasing the budget does not always correlate directly with the number of new customers opening deposits. Therefore, a model is needed that can quickly predict potential customers so that the marketing team can offer deposits only to those predicted to open one, thus minimizing marketing costs.
